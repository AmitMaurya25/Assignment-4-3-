    "\n",
    "In Python, data abstraction can be achieved through the use of classes and objects. Here are the steps to achieve data abstraction in Python:\n",
    "Define a Class: Create a class that represents the abstract data type you want to implement. The class should encapsulate the data\n",
    "and operations related to that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define Attributes: Declare attributes within the class to represent the data associated with the abstraction. \n",
    "These attributes will store the state of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define Methods: Implement methods within the class to define the operations or behaviors that can be performed on the data. \n",
    "These methods will manipulate the attributes and provide an interface for interacting with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulate Data: Ensure that the attributes and methods are appropriately encapsulated within the class.\n",
    "This means that the internal details and implementation of the class should be hidden from the outside world, \n",
    "and only the necessary interface should be exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Control: Python provides mechanisms for access control, such as public, private, and protected access modifiers. \n",
    "By default, all attributes and methods are public, but you can use naming conventions and \n",
    "access modifiers like underscores (_) to indicate private or protected members, limiting their visibility and access from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
